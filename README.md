Compiling the app:

1. Import the MensaUniBe and the google play services projects as existing projects into eclipse
- Go to Preferences -> Android -> Build and click "Browse" next to the field "Custom debug keystore". There select the debug.keystore
file from the MensaUniBe project folder. This key is required to use the google play services (maps).
- Run. (everything should work now.)
